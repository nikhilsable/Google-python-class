Functions in string1.py
----------------------

#A. donuts
Given an int count of a number of donuts, return a string
of the form 'Number of donuts: <count>', where <count> is the number
passed in. However, if the count is 10 or more, then use the word 'many'
instead of the actual count.
So donuts(5) returns 'Number of donuts: 5'
and donuts(23) returns 'Number of donuts: many'

# B. both_ends
Given a string s, return a string made of the first 2
and the last 2 chars of the original string,so 'spring' yields 'spng'. 
However, if the string lengthis less than 2, return instead the empty string.

# C. fix_start
Given a string s, return a string
where all occurences of its first char have
been changed to '*', except do not change
the first char itself.
e.g. 'babble' yields 'ba**le'
Assume that the string is length 1 or more.
Hint: s.replace(stra, strb) returns a version of string s
where all instances of stra have been replaced by strb.

# D. MixUp
Given strings a and b, return a single string with a and b separated
by a space '<a> <b>', except swap the first 2 chars of each string.
e.g.
   'mix', pod' -> 'pox mid'
   'dog', 'dinner' -> 'dig donner'
Assume a and b are length 2 or more.
